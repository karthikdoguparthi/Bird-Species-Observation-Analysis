# Bird-Species-Observation-Analysis

Youtube: 

In this project, I analyzed bird observation data collected from two ecosystems forests and grasslands. My goal was to understand how observer behavior, environmental conditions, and identification methods affect bird detection patterns, and ultimately use those insights to improve monitoring strategies and support biodiversity management.

I explored the relationship between observers and interval lengths. I noticed that most bird detections occurred within the first 2.5 minutes of the observation period, regardless of the habitat. Observers like Elizabeth Oswald and Kimberly Semo consistently recorded higher counts during these short intervals, especially in grasslands. That led me to think that shorter observation windows might be more effective.

Next, I looked at how birds were identified by calling, singing, or visualization and compared this across observers and habitats. Singing was by far the most dominant method of detection, particularly in grasslands. Observers in grasslands recorded hundreds more detections through singing than through any other method. This made me realize that acoustic detection (like bird songs) plays a bigger role in open habitats.

These insights gave me ideas that might benefit from focusing on sound detection and shorter intervals, while forest surveys may require more strategic planning to overcome visibility issues. I also noticed differences in performance among observers, which highlighted the importance of consistent training and calibration across teams.

I believe these findings can help optimize monitoring efforts and saving time, improving accuracy, and making better use of limited resources. The real value here for anyone involved in conservation or biodiversity research. I did not find any patterns that would lead to negative outcomes.

Problem Statement: 

The project aims to analyze the distribution and diversity of bird species in two distinct ecosystems: forests and grasslands. By examining bird species observations across these habitats, the goal is to understand how environmental factors, such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain, influence bird populations and their behavior. The study will involve working on the provided observational data of bird species present in both ecosystems, identifying patterns of habitat preference, and assessing the impact of these habitats on bird diversity. The findings can provide valuable insights into habitat conservation, biodiversity management, and the effects of environmental changes on avian communities.

Business Insights:

1. Use habitat-specific monitoring methods like listening ID in forests and visual ID in grasslands.

2. Standardize survey times and interval lengths based on peak bird activity periods.

3. Provide consistent training to observers to improve data accuracy.

4. Conduct surveys across all seasons to capture migration and seasonal diversity shifts.

5. Use environmental variables (temperature, humidity, etc.) to predict bird presence and plan surveys better.

Conclusion: 

This project helped me uncover key patterns in bird detection methods and observer performance across forest and grassland habitats. I realized that environmental factors and observation techniques significantly influence bird count data. Shorter intervals and acoustic methods proved especially effective in grasslands, while forests posed visibility challenges. These insights reinforced the importance of tailoring survey strategies to habitat types. Overall, this analysis deepened my understanding of bird monitoring practices and highlighted actionable steps to improve biodiversity assessments.
